### Added videoconferenceUrl field to Event Search API

Date: 01/12/2025

We added support for returning video conference URLs in the Calendar Search API (`POST /calendar/api/events/search`). 
Events containing the `X-OPENPAAS-VIDEOCONFERENCE` property will now include this value in the search response as `x-openpaas-videoconference`.

This enhancement enables the frontend to display a "Join visio" button for calendar events with attached video meetings, 
improving user experience.

Impact: This is a **breaking change** for existing OpenSearch indices. 

If you have an existing OpenSearch index for calendar events, you need to add the `videoconferenceUrl` field to your index mapping:

Add the new field to your existing index using the OpenSearch API:

```bash
PUT /calendar_events/_mapping
{
  "properties": {
    "videoconferenceUrl": {
      "type": "keyword",
      "index": false
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Replace `calendar_events` with your actual index name if different.
